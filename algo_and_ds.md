## Computer science is the study of algorithms

* Abstraction
    - Logical (how things are used, interface between it end user)
    - Physical (how things actually work, and take place under the hood)
* Procedural Abstraction
    - Black Box Thinking, using a function
* Data Abstraction
    - Abstract Data Typer (ADT) is an encapsulation of a data type
    - Provides an implementation-independent view of data

* Intractable - no solution
* Computable - solution exists

Error Handling
* Syntax error
    - missing a colon, paraenth
    - python cannot interpret the code written
* Logic error
    - gives wrong result
    - results in an exception
    - can be caught, with try/except or raised explicitly with raise

Thought problem
* Infinite Monkey Theorem
    - if a monkey typed randomly on a keyboard long enough, it will produce shakespeare

Inheritence
* Inheritance Heirarchy:
    - Shows the relationships between objects
    - Subclasses
    - Superclasses
* IS-A
    - Describes that a child class is related to a parent class
    - Includes inheretance
* HAS-A
    - Doesn't include inheretance
    - Are outside of the inheretance hierarchy
    - Have instances of the heirarchy within them

## Design Patterns
[link](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns)

Gang of Four (GOF)
* Program to an interface not an implementation
    - meaning program to the type of object you expect
* Favor object composition over inheritance
    - keep the number of objects to a min

Behavioral patterns
* Chain of responsibility
    - create a small chunk of code for a single thing
    - single responsibility principle
* Command
    - create blocks that have the same methods
    - tie them to a list and then grant ability to 'method' each, like undo
* Injection
    - configure objects within config and pass to everything else
    - as opposed to instantiating them within each use
* many more...

Strctural patterns
* Facade
    - a class that groups other classes as components under within it
* Interface
    - modify an existing heavily tested code with a different face
* Decorator
    -
